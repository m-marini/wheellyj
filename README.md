## Release 0.4.0

Compatible with Wheellino 0.2.x

- Added the radar map component that processes the proxy sensor signals creating a map of obstacles.
- The map feeds the neural network as environment state signals.

## Release 0.3.0

- The remote server is Java software running in JVM that implements the interaction between environment and agent.
- The environment can collect and drive the remote robot by Wi-Fi connection or simulate the robot in a virtual
  environment.

- The agent is based on Temporal Difference (TD) actor-critic algorithms with eligibility trace, the critic component
  use
  the residual advantage state value to evaluate the policy of actor.

## Release 0.2.0

- The remote server is Java software running in JVM that allow to drive the robot running different inference engine
  models (simple manual controller via joystick or state machine base engine).
- The software creates a 2D space model from the proximity and contact sensors and implements different basic behaviors
  that can be composed to build the state machine engine.

The basic behaviors are:

- stop for a while,
- single or random sensor scan with obstacle detection
- move direct to a location with sensor scanning for obstacles
- Find path to location avoiding obstacles (A* algorithm)
- Select sequentially target location from a list
- Select random target location from a list
- Complex behavior to secure the robot in a safe location (far way from obstacles)
- Complex behavior to follow the nearest obstacle at a safe distance
- Wait for robot unblock (robot is in a block state if it cannot move in any way)
